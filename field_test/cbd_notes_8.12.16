test #5 xcorr results were bad, therefore produced inaccurate results. simple repeat of test got good result
several failed attempts with shot position 8, calculating slightly larger length (0.505meters) vs actual 0.5 meters
shot 2 increased distance to about 80ft (first was about 45)
for shot 4 increased mic distance to 0.5056
